# Projects

This is my project folder. All of my coding work will be stored in separate folders that you may view freely.
Descriptions of each folder are below.

GameStuff - This folder contains all of my Game Programming files. 
            All files are stored in separate directories based on the language used.

        Java:
          Player/Game.java - a simple application that was written to implement a basic controller
                             using the WASD keys, and simple gravity.
                            
        Python:
          Project_1.py - a simple application that implements a basic controller and gravity. Also was
                         able to paint a picture as the player model/figure instead of a ball, as in 
                         the Java application.
          Physics_Engine.py - A physics Engine I made for the ADAM video game. Allows for creation of solid blocks,
                             collision detection, and physical entity creation
          Player_Assets.py - A player class for the ADAM video game that myself and another programmer worked on. 
          
Systems Programming - A folder dedicated to all of my Systems Programming work. Will contain all x86 / C / C++ based files.
                      Will mark files that were completed in school, as well as those completed in my own free time.
                      
            C:
                 htoi.c - a simple C function that allows a string of text to be entered in the format "0x######" / "0X######"
                 or "########". The String will be converted to its proper hexidecimal number.
                 
                 Rudimentary Syntax Parser - This file contains code that will check other programming files for simple syntax errors
                 (unbalanced paranthesis, missing semi-colons, unbalanced single / double quotes, etc.)
                 
                 ForFun - A folder dedicated to fun side projects that I embark on from time to time
                 
                        BinaryTree.h - header file for the BinaryTree Implementation file
                        
                        BinaryTree.cpp - Implementation file for the BinaryTree. Currently supports int data types. 
                        
                        Goal is to port it to a Template-Based BinaryTree that accepts any data. Will use BinaryTree for other
                        stuff later. 

Artificial Intelligence - A folder for all my A.I / M.L related work. 
            
            Homework: Homework folder for school. Generally all stuff here is written in Python
            
            Side Projects: The side projects I'll do related to school work. This folder contains stuff related to 
            low-level re-writes of code I've already developed and other stuff I wanted to do that sounded neat or cool.
