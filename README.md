# Projects

This is my project folder. All of my coding work will be stored in separate folders that you may view freely.
Descriptions of each folder are below.

GameStuff - This folder contains all of my Game Programming files. 
            All files are stored in separate directories based on the language used.

        Java:
          Player/Game.java - a simple application that was written to implement a basic controller
                             using the WASD keys, and simple gravity.
                            
        Python:
          Project_1.py - a simple application that implements a basic controller and gravity. Also was
                         able to paint a picture as the player model/figure instead of a ball, as in 
                         the Java application.
